## ABOUT
yelpapi is a pure Python implementation of the [Yelp Fusion API](https://www.yelp.com/developers/documentation/v3/get_started) (aka Yelp v3 API). It is simple, fast, and robust to any changes Yelp may make to the API in the future.

## REQUIREMENTS
This code requires Python 3.7 or higher and [requests](https://github.com/requests/requests).

## INSTALL
yelpapi is available on PyPI at https://pypi.python.org/pypi/yelpapi.

Install using [pip](http://www.pip-installer.org/):

    pip install yelpapi

Install from source:

    python setup.py install

## USING THIS CODE
This API is demonstrated more thoroughly in [examples.py](examples/examples.py), but the following chunk of code demonstrates basic use of yelpapi. 

```python
from yelpapi import YelpAPI
yelp_api = YelpAPI(api_key)
search_results = yelp_api.search_query(args)
```

You can also set timeouts so API calls do not block indefinitely in degraded network
conditions.

```python
from yelpapi import YelpAPI
yelp_api = YelpAPI(api_key, timeout_s=3.0)
search_results = yelp_api.search_query(args)
```
