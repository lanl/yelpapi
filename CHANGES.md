# Changes

## 2.5.0 (2022-08-04)
* Implemented new `close()` method to close the `requests.Session` object we use for performant API interactions. This can also be used as a context manager (this is the preferred way).
    * Clarified [`README.md`](README.md) to make it clear that the user should always be sure to close the connection.

## 2.4.1 (2022-08-01)
* Dropping EOL Python versions, adding newly-supported versions.
* Updating dependencies in [`requirements.txt`](requirements.txt).
* Updating project URL (moved from [@gfairchild](https://github.com/gfairchild)'s personal namespace to [@lanl](https://github.com/lanl)'s namespace).

## 2.4.0 (2019-04-19)
* `match_type` parameter for the business match endpoint was deprecated on April 1, 2019 (see [Yelp's changelog](https://www.yelp.com/developers/v3/changelog)). (courtesy @davebulaval)
* Added a check to ensure a required parameter, `address1`, is provided when using the business match endpoint. (courtesy @davebulaval)
* Support for Python versions <3.4 is removed (i.e., this no longer works with Python 2.7). This is due to some dependencies that also have abandoned Python 2 support.

## 2.3.0 (2018-07-11)
* Provided a means to set timeouts to API calls. (courtesy @goodspark)
* Added unit tests, including Travis CI automation. (courtesy @goodspark)

## 2.2.2 (2018-01-28)
* Add better top-level documentation for `YelpAPI`.
* To avoid wasting API calls on obviously invalid requests, consistently check for parameters required for requests to succeed.

## 2.2.1 (2018-01-28)
* Fix a few minor inconsistencies in the code.

## 2.2.0 (2018-01-28)
* Revised to remove token/secret access and instead use API keys. Yelp will move to API keys only in March 2018. (courtesy @tamos)
* An API key is now needed to instantiate a `YelpAPI` object. (courtesy @tamos)
* Added support for 3 new endpoints:
    * [Event Lookup API](https://www.yelp.com/developers/documentation/v3/event)
    * [Event Search API](https://www.yelp.com/developers/documentation/v3/event_search)
    * [Featured Event API](https://www.yelp.com/developers/documentation/v3/featured_event)
* `business_match_query` no longer assumes the country is the U.S. if the country code is missing.

## 2.1.0 (2017-10-19)
* Implement new [Business Match API](https://www.yelp.com/developers/documentation/v3/business_match).   
**NOTE**: This API is currently in beta. Yelp requires your app join the [Yelp Developer Beta Program](https://www.yelp.com/developers/v3/manage_app) to gain access to it.

## 2.0.1 (2017-02-27)
* Remove reliance on `ez_setup.py`.
* Add `setup.cfg` to instruct the build process to build universal wheels.

## 2.0 (2017-02-27)
* Implement the new Yelp Fusion API (aka Yelp v3 API). Note that yelpapi v1.4 is the last version to support the Yelp v2 API. [The Yelp v2 API is being deprecated, so all new developers should move to the new Fusion API ASAP.](https://engineeringblog.yelp.com/2017/02/recent-improvements-to-the-fusion-api.html)
    * Use OAuth 2.0 for authentication.
    * Implement new [Transaction Search API](https://www.yelp.com/developers/documentation/v3/transactions_search), [Reviews API](https://www.yelp.com/developers/documentation/v3/business_reviews), and [Autocomplete API](https://www.yelp.com/developers/documentation/v3/autocomplete).

## 1.4 (2016-05-10)
* Use HTTPS for all API calls.
* Use new string formatter.
* Remove `YelpError` since the business API now returns a JSON error when given a bad business ID.

## 1.3 (2015-05-22)
* Adding support for the [Phone Search API](https://www.yelp.com/developers/documentation/v2/phone_search).

## 1.2 (2013-10-08)
* yelpapi is now fully Python 3+ compliant.

## 1.1 (2013-10-04)
* Transitioning from using [python-oauth2](https://github.com/simplegeo/python-oauth2) and [requests](https://github.com/kennethreitz/requests) to just using [requests-oauthlib](https://github.com/requests/requests-oauthlib).
* Moving to setuptools (using [ez_setup.py](https://bitbucket.org/pypa/setuptools/downloads/ez_setup.py) to manage it).

## 1.0 (2013-10-03)
* Initial release.
